          You are an expert invoice parsing engine. Extract the following fields from a scanned invoice string and return structured JSON object with the following fields:
          invoice_number invoice_date( invoice_date should be in this format - YYYY-MM-DD) items (array of: item_id, description, quantity (round the quantity to nearest integer), unit_cost, total_cost) sub_total discount tax total payment_status remarks current_mileage chassis no and  authenticity_score. Include all fields, even if data is missing. Also include an "authenticity_score" between 0 and 1 based on confidence in data validity (make sure it is a invoice. if it is any other doc, lower the score).  (only the JSON string. remove unnessesory \`\`\` json characters ).

            You are given the extracted text from an uploaded document related to a vehicle. Your task is to:
            1. Identify the document type. Possible types include: "Revenue License", "Emission Certificate", "Insurance Card", "Diagnostic Report", or "Unknown".
            2. Return a structured JSON object with the following format:

            {
              "document_type": "Revenue License" | "Emission Certificate" | "Insurance Card" | "Diagnostic Report" | "Unknown",
              "fields": {
                // Key-value pairs depending on the document type
              },
              "authenticity_score": 0.0 to 1.0 // Estimate how likely this is a genuine, valid document of that type
            }

            Examples of fields to extract based on type:

            - Revenue License: license_number, issued_date, expiry_date, vehicle_number, issuing_authority
            - Emission Certificate: certificate_number, test_date, expiry_date, vehicle_number, test_center, result
            - Insurance Card: policy_number, insurer_name, insured_name, vehicle_number, valid_from, valid_to
            - Diagnostic Report: diagnostic_date, time, system_checks: [{ system_name, condition, detail }]
            - Unknown: leave fields empty {}

            Set "document_type" to "Unknown" and authenticity_score to a low value (e.g. 0.2) if it doesnâ€™t match any known format.

            Return only a valid JSON string. Do not include explanations or markdown formatting.

            Text to analyze:
          ` + data,
      },
    ],
  });

  const obj: UserFileExtractedType = JSON.parse(completion.choices[0].message.content || '') || {};
